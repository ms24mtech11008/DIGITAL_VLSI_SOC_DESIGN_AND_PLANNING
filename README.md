## How to talk to computers
### Introduction to QFN-48 Package, chip, pads, core, die and IPs
Absolutely — here’s a more detailed version of your outline, while still keeping it clear and concise. This version can fit well in a presentation, document, or technical write-up.

##  Example: Dissecting the ARDUINO Chip — From Board to Silicon

###  1. System-Level View: Arduino Board

We start by examining the **Arduino board** using a **block diagram**, where different functional components are shown, and the **main processor** (microcontroller) is highlighted. This processor is the heart of the system and handles the core logic and control tasks.

The Block diagram of the board will look like below

###  2. Processor Package (QFN-48)

Zooming into the processor block:

* The processor is enclosed in a **QFN-48** package — **Quad Flat No-lead** with **48 pins**.
* This **package** acts as the physical container for the chip, providing both protection and electrical connectivity.
* Inside the package, the **silicon chip** (or **die**) is placed in the center.
* The chip is connected to the **IO pins of the package** via **wire bonds**, which are tiny gold or aluminum wires.

###  3. Die-Level View: Inside the Chip

Within the package, the actual **chip** contains multiple layers of metal and silicon. Key physical elements include:

* **Pads**: Metal contact areas on the periphery of the die. These connect to the package pins via wire bonds.
* **Core**: The central region of the die that holds the digital and analog circuits.
* **Die**: The entire silicon piece, including the core, pads, and any other peripheral regions.

###  4. Core Components Breakdown

The **core** of the chip includes several important blocks:

####  Foundry IPs – Standard, Silicon-Proven Blocks

These are **pre-designed, validated modules provided by the foundry** (e.g., SkyWater):

* **SRAM** – Used as internal memory for storing data and instructions.
* **DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter)** – Converts digital signals into analog voltages.
* **ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)** – Converts analog signals from sensors into digital values.
* **PLL (Phase-Locked Loop)** – Generates and stabilizes clock signals for synchronization.

These blocks are known as **Foundry IPs** because they are created and maintained by the foundry for general use in chip designs.

####  Macros – Custom, Higher-Level Functional Blocks

These are **larger, more complex blocks**, typically developed by the chip design team or third-party IP providers:

* **RISC-V SoC** – A full **System on Chip** based on the open-source **RISC-V** architecture. This includes the CPU core, buses, memory interface, etc.
* **SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)** – A standard communication protocol used for talking to peripherals like sensors and memory chips.

These are called **Macros** because they are **pre-built, reusable modules**, often integrated as black-box components in the design.

###  5. Foundry IPs vs. Macros: What's the Difference?

| Aspect           | Foundry IPs                             | Macros                                      |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Provider         | Semiconductor foundry (e.g., SkyWater)  | Chip designer or third-party IP vendors     |
| Size/Complexity  | Small to medium, focused functions      | Large, complex subsystems or full cores     |
| Examples         | SRAM, PLL, ADC, DAC                     | RISC-V SoC, SPI interface                   |
| Customization    | Minimal (standard blocks)               | High (often tailored to the application)    |
| Integration Type | Built into the flow at transistor level | Integrated as black boxes (hardened blocks) |
